# ðŸ“ŠData with Danny SQL Challenges

This repository provides my solutions to some of the case studies from [Data with Danny's SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com).

These solutions are used to showcase both my experience and aptitude in SQL. Through these case studies I demonstrate my ability to leverage SQL queries to solve real world problems. I hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š.
